# VanGO-Java
The Java client for [VanGO](https://github.com/jadenyjw/vango).
#Usage
This program is a simple Swing GUI that connects to an already started Van Go server. It uses [Clarifai's](https://developer.clarifai.com) backend API as an image processing unit and [VLCJ](https://github.com/caprica/vlcj) as a VLC passthrough for RTSP streams.

This source code is compiled through Maven.
